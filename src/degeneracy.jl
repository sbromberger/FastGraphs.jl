    core_number(g)

Return the core number for each vertex in graph `g`.

A k-core is a maximal subgraph that contains vertices of degree `k` or more.
The core number of a vertex is the largest value `k` of a k-core containing
that vertex.

### Implementation Notes
Not implemented for graphs with self loops.

    k_core(g[, k]; corenum=core_number(g))

Return a vector of vertices in the k-core of graph `g`.
If `k` is not specified, return the core with the largest degree.

A k-core is a maximal subgraph that contains vertices of degree `k` or more.

"""
    k_shell(g[, k]; corenum=core_number(g))

Return a vector of vertices in the k-shell of `g`.
If `k` is not specified, return the shell of the core
with the largest degree.

The k-shell is the subgraph of vertices in the `k`-core but not in
the (`k+1`)-core. This is similar to `k_corona` but in that case
only neighbors in the k-core are considered.

Not implemented for graphs with parallel edges or self loops.

    k_crust(g[, k]; corenum=core_number(g))

Return a vector of vertices in the k-crust of `g`. 
If `k` is not specified, return the crust of the core with
the largest degree.

The k-crust is the graph `g` with the k-core removed.

### Implementation Notes
This definition of k-crust is different than the definition in References.
The k-crust in References is equivalent to the `k+1` crust of this algorithm.
