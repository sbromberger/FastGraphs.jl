"""
    clique_percolation(g, k=3)
 
Community detection using the clique percolation algorithm. Communities are potentionally overlapping.
Return a vector of vectors `c` such that `c[i]` is the set of vertices in community `i`. 
The parameter `k` defines the size of the clique to use in percolation.
