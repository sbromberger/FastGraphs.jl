    connected_components!(label, g)

Fill `label` with the `id` of the connected component in the undirected graph
`g` to which it belongs. Return a vector representing the component assigned
to each vertex. The component value is the smallest vertex ID in the component.

### Performance
This algorithm is linear in the number of edges of the graph.
