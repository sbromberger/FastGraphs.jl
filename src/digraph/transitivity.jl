"""
    transitiveclosure!(g, selflooped=false)

Compute the transitive closure of a directed graph, using the Floyd-Warshall
algorithm. If `selflooped` is true, add self loops to the graph.

### Performance
Time complexity is \\mathcal{O}(|V|^3).

### Implementation Notes
This version of the function modifies the original graph.
