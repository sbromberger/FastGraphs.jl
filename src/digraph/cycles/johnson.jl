Compute the theoretical maximum number of cycles in the directed graph `dg`.

The computation can be performed assuming the graph is complete or taking into account the
decomposition in strongly connected components (`byscc` parameter). The formula is coming from
[Johnson, 1973](Johnson).

    simplecycles(dg::::IsDirected)

Compute all cycles of the given directed graph, using
[Johnson, 1973](Johnson)'s algorithm and return them.

/!\ The number of cycles grow more than exponentially with the number of vertices,
you might want to use the algorithm with a ceiling -- `getcycles` -- on large directed graphs
(slightly slower). If you want to have an idea of the possible number of cycles,
look at function ```maxsimplecycles(dg::DiGraph, byscc::Bool = true)```.

Count the number of cycles in a directed graph, using

The `ceiling` is here to avoid memory overload if there are a lot of cycles in the graph.
Default value is 10^6, but it can be higher or lower. You can use the function
```maxsimplecycles(dg::DiGraph, byscc::Bool = true)``` to get an idea of the
theoretical maximum number or cycles.

Returns the minimum of the ceiling and the number of cycles.
