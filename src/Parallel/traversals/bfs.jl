    bfs_tree!(g, src, parents)

Provide a parallel breadth-first traversal of the graph `g` starting with source vertex `s`,
and return a parents array. The returned array is an Array of `Atomic` integers.

### Implementation Notes
This function uses `@threads` for parallelism which depends on the `JULIA_NUM_THREADS`
environment variable to decide the number of threads to use. Refer `@threads` documentation
for more details.
