"""
    abstract type VertexSubset

An abstract type used to denote a subset of vertices computed from various algorithms.
"""
abstract type VertexSubset end

"""
    vertex_cover(g, alg::VertexSubset)

Return the vertex cover of graph `g` using [`VertexCover`](@ref) algorithm `alg` as a vector
of vertices in the cover.
"""
function vertex_cover end

"""
    dominating_set(g, alg::VertexSubset)

Using a [`VertexSubset`](@ref) algorithm, find a set of vertices that consitute a dominating set (all vertices
in `g` are either adjacent to a vertex in the set or is a vertex in the set) and it is not possible to delete a
vertex from the set without sacrificing the dominating property.

### Implementation Notes
A vertex is said to be dominated if it is in the dominating set or adjacent to a vertex
in the dominating set.
"""
function dominating_set end

"""
    independent_set(g, alg::VertexSubset)

Obtain an [independent set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_set_(graph_theory)) of
`g` using the specifed [`VertexSubset`](@ref) algorithm.

### Implementation Notes
A vertex is said to be independent if it is not in the independent set or adjacent to any vertex
in the independent set.

"""
    struct DegreeSubset <: VertexSubset

A struct representing a degree-based greedy algorithm to calculate the
approximate vertex cover, minimal dominating set or maximal independent set.
"""

A struct representing an algorithm to calculate the approximate vertex cover,

    struct DistributedRandomSubset <: VertexSubset

A struct representing an algorithm to calculate the approximate vertex cover,

in parallel, returning the minimum (in case of vertex cover and dominating set)
or maximum (in case of independent set) result.
