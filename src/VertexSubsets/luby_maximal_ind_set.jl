    struct LubyMaximalIndSet <: VertexSubset

Struct representing a multithreaded algorithm to calculate the maximal [independent set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximal_independent_set)
of a graph.

### Optional Arguments
- `rng<:AbstractRNG`: override default random number generator (`GLOBAL_RNG`).

### Implementation Notes
The RNG used internally is a thread-safe Mersenne Twister. The implementation consists of a vector of Mersenne Twisters, one per thread.
The RNG optionally passed to the `LubyMaximalIndSet` struct is used to seed these Mersenne Twisters.
