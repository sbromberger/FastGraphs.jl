"""
    struct Johnson <: SimpleCycleAlgorithm

A `SimpleCycleAlgorithm` that specifies the use of Johnson.
If `iterative` is `true` (default: `false`), use an iterative
version of the algorithm and stop after `ceiling` iterations;
otherwise use the recursive version.

### Optional Parameters
`iterative::Bool`: If `iterative` is `true` (default: `false`), use an iterative
version of the algorithm and stop after `ceiling` iterations; otherwise use
the recursive version.
`ceiling::Int`: If `iterative` is `true`, stop after this many iterations (default 1e7).

### Performance Notes
Because the number of cycles grows more than exponentially with the number of vertices,
you might want to use the algorithm in iterative mode on large directed graphs.
If you want to have an idea of the possible number of cycles, look at function
[`max_simple_cycles()`](@ref). If you only need short cycles of a limited length, the
[`LimitedLength`](@ref) algorithm can be more efficient.

If the graph is small, the ceiling will not be reached and the recursive function
will be more efficient, as it avoids the overhead of the counting and testing if
the ceiling is reached. The iterative version returns all the cycles of the directed
graph if the `ceiling` is not reached; a subset of them otherwise.

    max_simple_cycles(dg::::IsDirected, byscc::Bool=true, scc_alg=Tarjan())

Compute the theoretical maximum number of cycles in the directed graph `dg`.

The computation can be performed assuming the graph is complete or taking into account the
decomposition in strongly connected components (`byscc` parameter). If `byscc` is `true`,
use the strong connectivity algorithm specified by `scc_alg` (default [`LightGraphs.Connectivity.Tarjan()`](@ref).


### Performance
A more efficient version is possible.

* `visitor`: Informations needed for the cycle computation, contains:

 the same as v, otherwise it should be passed.

### Implementation Notes
Implements Johnson's CIRCUIT function. This is a recursive version.
