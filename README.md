An optimized graphs package.

Simple graphs (not multi- or hypergraphs) are represented in a memory- and
time-efficient manner with adjacency lists and edge iterators. Both directed and
undirected graphs are supported via separate types, and conversion is available
from directed to undirected.

The project goal is to mirror the functionality of robust network and graph
analysis libraries such as [NetworkX](http://networkx.github.io) while being
simpler to use and more efficient than existing Julian graph libraries such as
[Graphs.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLang/Graphs.jl). It is an explicit design
decision that any data not required for graph manipulation (attributes and
other information, for example) is expected to be stored outside of the graph
structure itself. Such data lends itself to storage in more traditional and
better-optimized mechanisms.

## Core Concepts
A graph *G* is described by a set of vertices *V* and edges *E*:
*G = {V, E}*. *V* is an integer range `1:n`; *E* is represented as forward
(and, for directed graphs, backward) adjacency lists indexed by vertices. Edges
may also be accessed via an iterator that yields `Edge` types containing
`(src::Int, dst::Int)` values.

*LightGraphs.jl* provides two graph types: `Graph` is an undirected graph, and
`DiGraph` is its directed counterpart.

Graphs are created using `Graph()` or `DiGraph()`; there are several options
(see below for examples).

Edges are added to a graph using `add_edge!(g, e)`. Instead of an edge type
integers may be passed denoting the source and destination vertices (e.g.,
`add_edge!(g, 1, 2)`).

Multiple edges between two given vertices are not allowed: an attempt to
add an edge that already exists in a graph will result in a silent failure.

Edges may be removed using `rem_edge!(g, e)`. Alternately, integers may be passed
denoting the source and destination vertices (e.g., `rem_edge!(g, 1, 2)`). Note
that, particularly for very large graphs, edge removal is a (relatively)
expensive operation. An attempt to remove an edge that does not exist in the graph will result in an
error.

Use `nv(g)` and `ne(g)` to compute the number of vertices and edges respectively.

`rem_vertex!(g, v)` alters the vertex identifiers. In particular, calling `n=nv(g)`, it swaps `v` and `n` and then removes `n`.

`edges(g)` returns an iterator to the edge set. Use `collect(edge(set))` to fill
an array with all edges in the graph.

## Installation
Installation is straightforward:
```julia
julia> Pkg.add("LightGraphs")
```

## Usage Examples
(all examples apply equally to `DiGraph` unless otherwise noted):

```julia
# create an empty undirected graph
g = Graph()

# create a 10-node undirected graph with no edges
g = Graph(10)
@assert nv(g) == 10

# create a 10-node undirected graph with 30 randomly-selected edges
g = Graph(10,30)

# add an edge between vertices 4 and 5
add_edge!(g, 4, 5)

# remove an edge between vertices 9 and 10
rem_edge!(g, 9, 10)

# create vertex 11
add_vertex!(g)

# remove vertex 2
# attention: this changes the id of vertex nv(g) to 2
rem_vertex!(g, 2)

# get the neighbors of vertex 4
neighbors(g, 4)

# iterate over the edges
m = 0
for e in edges(g)
    m += 1
end
@assert m == ne(g)

# show distances between vertex 4 and all other vertices
dijkstra_shortest_paths(g, 4).dists

# as above, but with non-default edge distances
distmx = zeros(10,10)
distmx[4,5] = 2.5
distmx[5,4] = 2.5
dijkstra_shortest_paths(g, 4, distmx=distmx).dists

# graph I/O
g = load("mygraph.jgz", "mygraph")
save("mygraph.jgz", g, "mygraph", compress=true)
```
