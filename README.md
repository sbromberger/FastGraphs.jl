An optimized graphs package.

Simple graphs (not multi- or hypergraphs) are represented in a memory- and
time-efficient manner with adjacency lists and edge iterators. Both directed and
undirected graphs are supported via separate types, and conversion is available
from directed to undirected.

The project goal is to mirror the functionality of robust network and graph
analysis libraries such as [NetworkX](http://networkx.github.io) while being
simpler to use and more efficient than existing Julian graph libraries such as
[Graphs.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLang/Graphs.jl). It is an explicit design
decision that any data not required for graph manipulation (attributes and
other information, for example) is expected to be stored outside of the graph
structure itself. Such data lends itself to storage in more traditional and
better-optimized mechanisms.

### Core Concepts
A graph *G* is described by a set of vertices *V* and edges *E*:
*G = {V, E}*. *V* is an integer range `1:n`; *E* is represented as forward (and, for DiGraphs, backward) adjacency lists indexed by vertex. Edges may also be accessed via an iterator that yields `Edge` types containing `(src::Int, dst::Int)` values.

Multiple edges between two given vertices are not allowed: an attempt to add an edge that already exists in a graph will result in a silent failure.

Edge distances for most traversals may be passed in as a sparse or dense matrix
of `Float64` values, indexed by `[src,dst]` vertices. That is,
`distmx[2,4] = 2.5` assigns the distance `2.5` to the (directed) edge
connecting vertex 2 and vertex 4. Note that for undirected graphs,
`distmx[4,2]` should also be set.

Any graph traversal (in shortest-path/etc) will traverse an edge only if it is present in the graph. When a distance matrix is passed in,

1. distance values for undefined edges will be ignored, and
2. any unassigned values (in sparse distance matrices), for edges that are present in the graph, will be assumed to take the default value of 1.0.
3. any zero values (in sparse/dense distance matrices), for edges that are present in the graph, will instead have an implicit edge cost of 1.0.

### Basic Usage
(all examples apply equally to `DiGraph` unless otherwise noted):

```julia
# create an empty undirected graph
g = Graph()

# create a 10-node undirected graph with no edges
g = Graph(10)

# create a 10-node undirected graph with 30 randomly-selected edges
g = Graph(10,30)

# add an edge between vertices 4 and 5
add_edge!(g, 4, 5)

# remove an edge between vertices 9 and 10
rem_edge!(g, 9, 10)

# get the neighbors of vertex 4
neighbors(g, 4)

# show distances between vertex 4 and all other vertices
dijkstra_shortest_paths(g, 4).dists  

# as above, but with non-default edge distances
distmx = zeros(10,10)
distmx[4,5] = 2.5
distmx[5,4] = 2.5
dijkstra_shortest_paths(g, 4, distmx=distmx).dists

# graph I/O
g = load("mygraph.jgz", "mygraph")
save(g,"mygraph.jgz"; compress=true)
```
