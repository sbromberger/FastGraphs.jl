## Bipartite Matching
*LightGraphs.jl* supports maximum weight maximal matching computation on bipartite graphs
through linear programming relaxation.  In fact, on bipartite graphs, the solution
of the linear problem is integer.

Installation of the `JuMP` package is required.
```
maximum_weight_maximal_matching{T<:Number}(g, w::Dict{Edge,T})
maximum_weight_maximal_matching{T<:Number}(g, w::Dict{Edge,T}, cutoff)
```

Given a bipartite graph `g` and an edgemap `w` containing weights associated to edges, returns a matching with the maximum total weight among the ones containing the greatest number of edges.

Edges in `g` not present in `w` will not be considered for the matching.

The algorithm relies on a linear relaxation on of the matching problem, which is guaranteed to have integer solution on bipartite graps.

Eventually a `cutoff` argument can be given, to reduce computational times excluding edges with weights lower than the cutoff.

The package JuMP.jl and one of its supported solvers is required.

The returned object is of type

```
type MatchingResult
    weight::Float64
    inmatch::Dict{Edge,Bool}
    m::Vector{Int}
end
```

where

weight: total weight of the matching

inmatch: `inmatch[e]=true` if edge `e` belongs to the matching.

m:       `m[i]=j` if vertex `i` is matched to vertex `j`.          `m[i]=-1` for unmatched vertices.
