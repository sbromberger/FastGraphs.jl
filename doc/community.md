# Community Structures
*LightGraphs.jl* contains many algorithm to detect and analize community structures
in graphs.

## clustering coefficients
```
local_clustering_coefficient(g, vlist = vertices(g))
```

Returns a vector containing  the [local clustering coefficients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustering_coefficient) for vertices `vlist`.

```
local_clustering_coefficient(g, v)
```

Computes the [local clustering coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustering_coefficient) for node `v`.

```
local_clustering(g, vlist = vertices(g))
```

Returns two vectors, respectively containing  the first and second result of `local_clustering_coefficients(g, v)` for each `v` in `vlist`.

```
local_clustering(g, v)
```

Returns a tuple `(a,b)`, where `a` is the number of triangles in the neighborhood of `v` and `b` is the maximum number of possible triangles. It is related to the local clustering coefficient  by `r=a/b`.

```
global_clustering_coefficient(g)
```

Computes the [global clustering coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustering_coefficient).

## modularity
```
modularity(g, c)
```

Computes Newman's modularity `Q` for graph `g` given the partitioning `c`.

## community detection
```
community_detection_nback(g, k::Int)
```

Community detection using the spectral properties of the non-backtracking matrix of `g` (see [Krzakala et al.](http://www.pnas.org/content/110/52/20935.short)).

`g`: imput Graph `k`: number of communities to detect

return : array containing vertex assignments

## core-periphery
```
core_periphery_deg(g)
```

A simple degree-based core-periphery detection algorithm (see [Lip](http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.5511)). Returns the vertex assignments (1 for core and 2 for periphery).
