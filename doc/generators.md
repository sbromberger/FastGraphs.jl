### Random Graphs
*LightGraphs.jl* implements two common random graph generators:

`erdos_renyi(n, p[, is_directed=false])`  
Creates an [Erdős–Rényi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erdős–Rényi_model) random
graph with *n* vertices. Edges are added between pairs of vertices with probability
*p*. Undirected graphs are created by default; use `is_directed=true` to override.

`sparse_erdos_renyi(n, p[, is_directed=false])`
When *p* is small do only O(n) work to generate a uniform random sparse graph.
See `erdos_renyi(n, p[, is_directed=false])` for more information.

`watts_strogatz(n, k, β[, is_directed=false])`  
Creates a [Watts-Strogatz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watts_and_Strogatz_model) small
model random graph with *n* vertices, each with degree *k*. Edges are randomized per
the model based on probability *β*. Undirected graphs are created by default; use `is_directed=true` to override.

### Static Graphs
*LightGraphs.jl* also implements a collection of classic graph generators:


`CompleteGraph(n)`  
`CompleteDiGraph(n)`  
Creates a complete graph with *n* vertices. A complete graph has edges connecting each pair of vertices.

`StarGraph(n)`  
`StarDiGraph(n)`  
Creates a star graph with *n* vertices. A star graph has a central vertex with edges to each other vertex.

`PathGraph(n)`  
`PathDiGraph(n)`  
Creates a path graph with *n* vertices. A path graph connects each successive vertex by a single edge.

`WheelGraph(n)`  
`WheelDiGraph(n)`  
Creates a wheel graph with *n* vertices. A wheel graph is a star graph with the outer vertices connected via a closed path graph.
