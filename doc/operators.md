*LightGraphs.jl* implements the following graph operators. In general,
functions with two graph arguments will require them to be of the same type
(either both `Graph` or both `DiGraph`).
### complement
```
complement(g::LightGraphs.Graph)
complement(g::LightGraphs.DiGraph)
```
```rst
..  complement(s)

Returns the set-complement of :obj:`IntSet` ``s``.
```

Produces the [graph complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_graph) of a graph.

### reverse
```
reverse(g::LightGraphs.DiGraph)
```
```
reverse(s::AbstractString) -> AbstractString
```

Reverses a string

```
reverse(v [, start=1 [, stop=length(v) ]] )
```

Return a copy of `v` reversed from start to stop.

(`DiGraph` only) Produces a graph where all edges are reversed from the original.

### reverse!
```
reverse!(g::LightGraphs.DiGraph)
```
```rst
..  reverse!(v [, start=1 [, stop=length(v) ]]) -> v

In-place version of :func:`reverse`.
```

(`DiGraph` only) In-place reverse (modifies the original graph).

### blkdiag
```
blkdiag{T<:Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph}}(g::T<:Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph}, h::T<:Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph})
```
```
blkdiag(A...)
```

Concatenate matrices block-diagonally. Currently only implemented for sparse matrices.

Produces a graph with $|V(g)| + |V(h)|$ vertices and $|E(g)| + |E(h)|$ edges.

Put simply, the vertices and edges from graph `h` are appended to graph `g`.

### union
```
union{T<:Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph}}(g::T<:Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph}, h::T<:Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph})
```
```
union(s1,s2...)
∪(s1,s2...)
```

Construct the union of two or more sets. Maintains order with arrays.

Merges graphs `g` and `h` by taking the set union of all vertices and edges.

### intersect
```
intersect{T<:Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph}}(g::T<:Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph}, h::T<:Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph})
```
```
intersect(s1,s2...)
∩(s1,s2)
```

Construct the intersection of two or more sets. Maintains order and multiplicity of the first argument for arrays and ranges.

Produces a graph with edges that are only in both graph `g` and graph `h`.

Note that this function may produce a graph with 0-degree vertices.

### difference
```
difference{T<:Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph}}(g::T<:Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph}, h::T<:Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph})
```
Produces a graph with edges in graph `g` that are not in graph `h`.

Note that this function may produce a graph with 0-degree vertices.

### symmetric_difference
```
symmetric_difference{T<:Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph}}(g::T<:Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph}, h::T<:Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph})
```
Produces a graph with edges from graph `g` that do not exist in graph `h`, and vice versa.

Note that this function may produce a graph with 0-degree vertices.

### induced_subgraph
```
induced_subgraph{T<:Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph}}(g::T<:Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph}, iter)
```
Filters graph `g` to include only the vertices present in the iterable argument `vs`. Returns the subgraph of `g` induced by `vs`.

### join
```
join(g::LightGraphs.Graph, h::LightGraphs.Graph)
```
```
join(strings, delim, [last])
```

Join an array of `strings` into a single string, inserting the given delimiter between adjacent strings. If `last` is given, it will be used instead of `delim` between the last two strings. For example, `join(["apples", "bananas", "pineapples"], ", ", " and ") == "apples, bananas and pineapples"`.

`strings` can be any iterable over elements `x` which are convertible to strings via `print(io::IOBuffer, x)`.

Merges graphs `g` and `h` using `blkdiag` and then adds all the edges between  the vertices in `g` and those in `h`.

### tensor_product
```
tensor_product{G<:Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph}}(g::G<:Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph}, h::G<:Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph})
```
Returns the (tensor product)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_product_of_graphs] of `g` and `h`

### cartesian_product
```
cartesian_product{G<:Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph}}(g::G<:Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph}, h::G<:Union{LightGraphs.DiGraph,LightGraphs.Graph})
```
Returns the (cartesian product)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_product_of_graphs] of `g` and `h`

### crosspath
```
crosspath(len, h)
```
Replicate h len times and connect each vertex with its copies in a path
