*LightGraphs.jl* implements the following graph operators. In general, functions with two graph arguments will require them to be of the same type (either both `Graph` or both `DiGraph`).

`complement(g)`  
Produces the [graph complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_graph) of a graph.

`reverse(g)`  
(`DiGraph` only) Produces a graph where all edges are reversed from the original.

`reverse!(g)`  
(`DiGraph` only) In-place reverse (modifies the original graph).

`blkdiag(g, h)`  
Produces a graph with `|V(g)| + |V(h)|` vertices and `|E(g)| + |E(h)|` edges. Put simply, the vertices and edges from graph *h* are appended to graph *g*.

`intersect(g, h)`  
Produces a graph with edges that are only in both graph *g* and graph *h*. Note that this function may produce a graph with 0-degree vertices.

`difference(g, h)`  
Produces a graph with edges in graph *g* that are not in graph *h*. Note that this function may produce a graph with 0-degree vertices.

`symmetric_difference(g, h)`  
Produces a graph with edges from graph *g* that do not exist in graph *h*, and vice versa. Note that this function may produce a graph with 0-degree vertices.

`union(g, h)`  
Merges graphs *g* and *h* by taking the set union of all vertices and edges.

`induced_subgraph(g, vs)`
`g[vs]`
Filters graph *g* to include only the vertices present in the iterable argument *vs*. Returns the subgraph of *g* induced by *vs*.
