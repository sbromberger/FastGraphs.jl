# Experimental Graph Algorithms

LightGraphs.Experimental is a module for graph algorithms that are newer or less stable. We can adopt algorithms before we finalized and interface for using them or if we feel that full support cannot be provided to the current implementation. You can expect new developments to land here before they make it into the main module. This enables the development to keep advancing without being risk averse because of stability guarantees. You can think of this module as a 0.X semantic version space. Where you can play around with new algorithms, perspectives, interfaces without fear of making a mistake.


## Graph Isomorphism

Here is the documentation for graph isomorphism functions.
